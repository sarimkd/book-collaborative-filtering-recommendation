# Collaborative Filtering Based Book Recommendation System

Welcome to the Collaborative Filtering Based Book Recommendation System repository! This repository contains code and resources for building and implementing a Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System for books. Collaborative Filtering is a powerful technique that leverages user behavior and preferences to provide personalized recommendations. In the context of books, this system analyzes how users have rated and interacted with books in the past to suggest new titles that align with their tastes.

## Introduction

A Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System is designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by suggesting books that users are likely to enjoy based on patterns in their historical preferences. It identifies similar users and recommends books that those users have rated highly, thus creating a network of user-to-book connections.

This system is particularly effective in cases where explicit information about the content of books is limited or when users are seeking books beyond their immediate awareness. It opens up opportunities for readers to discover titles that might not have been on their radar.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** User ratings data is collected, capturing how users have rated different books in the system.

2. **User-Item Matrix:** A matrix is constructed where rows represent users, columns represent books, and the cells contain ratings or interactions.

3. **Calculating Similarity:** Similarity scores are computed between users based on their rating patterns. Cosine Similarity is a common metric used to quantify the similarity between users.

4. **Recommendation Generation:** For a given user, the system identifies similar users and recommends books that these similar users have highly rated but the target user has not interacted with.

5. **User Interaction:** Users can input their preferences, or the system can proactively offer recommendations on a webpage or app interface.

## Setup
